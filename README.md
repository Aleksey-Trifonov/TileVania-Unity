# Complete Unity Developer - Section 6 - TileVania

This is the Complete Unity Developer - one of the most successful e-learning courses on the internet! Completely re-worked from scratch with brand-new projects and our latest teaching techniques. You will benefit from the fact we have already taught over 360,336 students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo.

## In This Section
Build a Speulnky-like level in under one minute using a procedural Tilemap smart brush that you build yourself! (Section REF: TV_CUD)

## How To Build / Compile
This is a Unity project. If you're familiar with source control, then "clone this repo". Otherwise download the contents, and navigate to `Assets > Levels` then open any `.unity` file.

This branch is the course branch, each commit corresponds to a lecture in the course. The current state is our latest progress.
